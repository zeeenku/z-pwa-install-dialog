Examples
--------

### Minimal Simple Example

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the component in your app:

    
    import { ZPwaInstallDialog } from 'z-pwa-install-dialog-react';
    
    function App() {
      return (
        <>
          Hello, this is a demo for the PWA install dialog package
          
            Install
          
        
      );
    }
    
    export default App;
      

### Customizing the Trigger Element

You can customize the trigger element. This example shows how to pass your own trigger:

    
    import { ZPwaInstallDialog } from 'z-pwa-install-dialog-react';
    
    function App() {
      return (
        <>
          Hello, this is a demo for the PWA install dialog package
          
            {/* Your custom trigger element */}
            Install PWA
          
        
      );
    }
    
    export default App;
      

### Customizing the Dialog

If you want to customize the dialog itself, you can pass additional props for the dialog's content and behavior:

    
    import { ZPwaInstallDialog } from 'z-pwa-install-dialog-react';
    
    function App() {
      let open = true;
    
      const handleDownload = () => {
        // Handle download logic here
      };
    
      const handleClose = () => {
        // Handle close logic here
      };
    
      return (
        <>
          Hello, this is a demo for the PWA install dialog package
          
            Install
          
        
      );
    }
    
    export default App;
      

### Creating Your Own Instructions Component

You can also create your own instructions component to be displayed within the dialog:

    
    import { ZPwaInstallInstruc } from 'z-pwa-install-dialog-react';
    
    function App() {
      return (
        <>
          Hello, this is a demo for the PWA install dialog package
          
        
      );
    }
    
    export default App;
